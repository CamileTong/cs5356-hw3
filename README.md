## Implementation Notes

### New HTML Element: `<details>`
I implemented the `<details>` element to create an interactive disclosure widget. Never knew I can do it without JavaScript. It's cool! And very easy to use. 

### New CSS Property: `transform`
I used the CSS `transform` property with `scale()` function to create an engaging hover effect on the fox button. When users hover over the button, it smoothly scales up to 105% of its original size, providing a subtle but satisfying interactive feedback.
